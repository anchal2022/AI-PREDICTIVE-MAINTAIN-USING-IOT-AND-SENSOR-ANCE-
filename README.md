Project Title:

Smart AI Predictive Maintenance System

📝 1-Line Description:

An AI and IoT-based system that predicts machine failures in advance to reduce breakdowns and improve efficiency.

❗ Problem Statement:

Industries often face unexpected machine failures which lead to production delays, high repair costs, and safety issues.
There is a need for a smart solution that can predict faults before they occur using real-time data.

🔍 Approach / Methodology:

We used IoT sensors to collect live machine data (like temperature, pressure, vibration).
This data is processed using Machine Learning models to detect patterns and anomalies.
The system sends predictive alerts before failures and displays insights on a dashboard.

📈 Results & Impact:

Helped in early detection of faults, reducing downtime significantly

Improved machine lifespan and maintenance planning

Reduced unplanned costs and increased overall operational efficiency
